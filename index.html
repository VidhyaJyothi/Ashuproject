     <!-- second paragraph-->
      <p>
    Agricultural system is the process of cyclic activities based on the natural sources. 
    Current agricultural system is using equipment, fertilizers, pesticide and hybrid seeds 
    to get more production and productivity of crops. To get more yield and satisfy the food 
    demand, chemical fertilizers and pesticides are used to protect the crops.
    The organic manures are easily decomposable and not harmfulto environment and human health. 
    This paper presents a study on organic and inorganic fertilizers, their impacts and side effects.
    It also surveys the computer algorithms and tools which play a major role in the field of 
    farming to save and support ecology.Optimization algorithms can be applied to optimize the usage 
    of fertilizers and organic manures in the effective manner.

    Artificial Intelligence is a discipline that can empower machines to execute tasks in real-time 
    situations and cognitive processing as the human mind. Interestingly, applications of artificial
    intelligence in agriculture guides farmers through the process of growing, sowing, harvesting, 
    and sale of produce. A plethora of artificial intelligence services such as recommendation engines, 
    predictive analytics, computer vision, coupled with IoT devices can significantly boost agricultural 
    productivity.

    With the help of AI, farm data like temperature, weather conditions, soil conditions, 
    and soil usage can be effectively collected and analyzed to influence decision making on 
    the farm which makes best possible crop suggestion before the season keeping the past data
    and other sensor, environment data in the view.

    Producers continue to integrate technology, mechanization and improved processes to their operations. 
    These allow farms to create efficiency, achieve scale and maximize profitability. 
    Farms are using data-driven technologies, such as GPS and GIS soil mapping, to bring 
    increasing precision and accuracy to seeding, harvesting and input use. Technologies in 
    the greenhouse and livestock sectors are advancing the world of farm automation at the push 
    of a button.

   <p>
    The agricultural sector is set to receive a facelift in organic farming and other aspects of 
    safe farming with AI-driven precision farming techniques. Artificial intelligence is taking over 
    the world one sector at a time, and there is a great promise on how it can bring effectiveness and
    ease to the highly labor-intensive agricultural processes.
